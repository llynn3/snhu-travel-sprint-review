## Reflection: Sprint Review & Retrospective  

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with us? 
For me, interpreting user needs means really trying to understand what the user is trying to achieve, not just what features they ask for on the surface. Creating user stories helps a lot with this because it forces me to think about the feature from the user’s point of view. It’s like having a small, focused goal that’s easy to build toward and easy to check when it’s done.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I try to break development down into smaller steps so I can stay flexible as things change. I’ve found that working incrementally and checking in with the team often helps projects stay on track. In the future, I want to use Agile processes like sprint planning, retrospectives, and continuous testing so I can keep improving the product as I go.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member helps the team succeed as a whole – it’s not just about finishing your piece. It means communicating clearly, being supportive, and helping solve problems when they come up. It’s also about being flexible and willing to adjust when priorities shift or feedback comes in.
